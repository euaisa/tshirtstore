<h1>TechThreads T-Shirt Store</h1>

This is an e-commerce website that allows users to browse and purchase tech-themed t-shirts. The website was built using HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery Mobile.

The main goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing online store that showcases tech-themed t-shirts. The website features a clean and modern design, with a responsive layout that makes it easy to browse on any device.

Users can browse through the collection of t-shirts, view product details, and add items to their cart. The website also includes a checkout process that allows users to complete their purchase using a simulated payment system.

The project was a collaboration between two developers and was completed as a way to showcase their skills in HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery Mobile.

Feel free to use the code as a reference or as a starting point for your own e-commerce website. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue in the repository.
